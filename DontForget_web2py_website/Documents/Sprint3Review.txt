Overall, we finally have a few standout working features that create a good amount of functionality for our web app. We are extremely close to having a fully shippable product that will look streamlined and intuitive. We finished up a lot of work that was left over from sprint 2, as well as we finished some tasks that were a part of sprint 3. What should we stop doing?Everything is very fragmented. Everyone is working on their own parts which causes some confusion at the beginning of meetings. We did not utilize git source control enough. What should we start doing?We should start being more organized with our code, where we are all working on the same code base. We  could also have our features more defined and set in stone. What is working well that we should continue doing?The meetings we have had weekly, around 3 per week, have been extremely helpful and have ensured that we’ve stayed on track by having us present some sort of contribution when we show up to the meeting.Completed Work: - User is able to opt of reminders through a text message response- User is able to view all reminders he/she has created- User is able to request and add friends to send reminders- User is able to send already created reminders to friends- An updated layout that looks clean and does not use the standard web2py buttons/forms.- Secured a domain for our web app- Parsing text responses- Getting a script to send reminders at their set timeNot Completed- An address book model to send reminders to friends- Better layoutWork Completion Rate:  ~85%
